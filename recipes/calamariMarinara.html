        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Calamari has an unfair reputation for being tricky to work with and that it's rubbery when cooked. Here's the secret: cook it in 45 seconds or 45 minutes--very quickly or a long slow simmer. For this marinara dish, I use the long simmer method. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
                <li>1 yellow onion, sliced thin </li>
                <li>1 serrano chile pepper, sliced thin </li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed or minced </li>
                <li>1 anchovy fillet </li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
                <li>teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed </li>
                <li>1 cup clam juice </li>
                <li>6 cups crushed or pureed Italian plum tomatoes </li>
                <li>teaspoon dried oregano </li>
                <li>2 pounds frozen calamari (tubes and tentacles), thawed, sliced into 1/2-inch pieces </li>
                <li>cup freshly chopped Italian parsley </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry pasta </li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Drizzle olive oil into saucepan (not over heat). Add onions, Serrano pepper, garlic, anchovy filet, red pepper flakes, and salt. Place pot over medium-high heat. When onions start to sizzle after a minute or so, stir and cook until onions and garlic just start to turn golden, 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in wine.</li>
                <li>Cook until wine is reduced by about half, 3 to 5 minutes. Add clam juice, tomatoes, and oregano. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. When sauce begins to bubble, reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer gently for about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer calamari to sauce pot; stir gently. Simmer until calamari are tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in parsley.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Stir some sauce into the hot, drained pasta. Serve in warm bowls topped with more marinara sauce and grated cheese.</li>
            </ol>
